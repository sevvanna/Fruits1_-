    "Web is a huge graph. So if we try to traverse it, we would be able to visit nodes present on the web. For traversal, we can use BFS as we want to cover the width of the graph and go as wide as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "A BFS implementation includes a queue which stores all the child nodes of a particular visited node and the crawler logic keeps running until the queue becomes empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic implementation of the crawler would include an in-memory array for the crawl queue. But if you can imagine, the size of this array can increase very rapidly and we might soon reach the heap limit. \n",

    "Another reason not to maintain it in memory is the restriction it puts while using multiple threads for crawling. At scale, you wouldn't run a single instance of the crawler as it will take a large amount of time to traverse even a tiny portion of the web. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since crawling is something that can be done parallely, given we maintain a track of visited links, we can easily deploy multiple instances of crawler visiting links and using a shared queue (Redis or RabbitMQ is recommended).\n",

    "# <font color='blue'> Maze generation algorithm </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Maze generation algorithms are automated methods for the creation of mazes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells (most commonly a rectangular grid but other arrangements are possible) with wall sites between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This predetermined arrangement can be considered as a connected graph with the edges representing possible wall sites and the nodes representing cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the maze generation algorithm can then be considered to be making a subgraph in which it is challenging to find a route between two particular nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the subgraph is not connected, then there are regions of the graph that are wasted because they do not contribute to the search space. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph contains loops, then there may be multiple paths between the chosen nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, maze generation is often approached as generating a random spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='blue'> Randomized depth-first search </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm, also known as the \"recursive backtracker\" algorithm, is a randomized version of the depth-first search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently implemented with a stack, this approach is one of the simplest ways to generate a maze using a computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the space for a maze being a large grid of cells (like a large chess board), each cell starting with four walls. Starting from a random cell, the computer then selects a random neighbouring cell that has not yet been visited. \n",
    "\n",
    "The computer removes the wall between the two cells and marks the new cell as visited, and adds it to the stack to facilitate backtracking. The computer continues this process, with a cell that has no unvisited neighbours being considered a dead-end. \n",
    "\n",
    "When at a dead-end it backtracks through the path until it reaches a cell with an unvisited neighbour, continuing the path generation by visiting this new, unvisited cell (creating a new junction). \n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until every cell has been visited, causing the computer to backtrack all the way back to the beginning cell. We can be sure every cell is visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be rearranged into a loop by storing backtracking information in the maze itself. This also provides a quick way to display a solution, by starting at any given point and backtracking to the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NvCuvFbUQ-x4KzJFbq5tfZC7pmMZgUCz\" width=600px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mazes generated with a depth-first search have a low branching factor and contain many long corridors, because the algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using backtracking. This can be described with a following recursive routine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a current cell as a parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mark the current cell as visited\n",
    "\n",
    "3. While the current cell has any unvisited neighbour cells\n",
    "      \n",
    "      a. Choose one of the unvisited neighbours\n",
    "      \n",
    "      b. Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell\n",
    "      \n",
    "      c. Invoke the routine recursively for a chosen cell\n",
    "      \n",
    "      d. which is invoked once for any initial cell in the area."
